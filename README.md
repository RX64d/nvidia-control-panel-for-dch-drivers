# nvidia-control-panel-for-dch-drivers
An easier way to add nvidia control panel in DCH drivers. The file is in .net 7 but using AOT so you don't need to install the net api.  To use run nvidiapanel.exe  if you want to do your own build use the command "dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release" in terminal and after exit the final file will be "net7.0\win-x64-native".
